# Task 1 - Temperature conversion

## Introduction

The program `convert.py` is designed to ask for a temperature in Fahrenheit, read it from the user, convert it to the Celsius scale, and then print out the result. Here are your tasks:
    
1. Rewrite the function `fahrenheit_to_celsius` so that it calculates correctly. (2 points)
2. Extend the program with a function that converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit. (2 points)
3. Extend the program so that it asks which conversion you want to do. (2 points)
4. Extend the program so that it continues to ask for conversions until the user exits by entering q (short for quit). (2 points)
5. Extend the program so that it can also convert to and from Kelvin, both from and to Celsius and Fahrenheit. For full credit, the program should continue asking which conversion to do until the user inputs q. (2 points)
