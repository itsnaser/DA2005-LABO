# DA2005-LABO
📊 All 5 Labs of DA2005 Programming Techniques Course at Stockholm University 🎓

# Task 1 - Temperature conversion

## Introduction

The program `convert.py` is designed to ask for a temperature in Fahrenheit, read it from the user, convert it to the Celsius scale, and then print out the result. Here are your tasks:
    
# Task 2 - Polynomials

## Introduction

In this lab, we will represent polynomials using lists of coefficients. The word “representation” here
means approximately “way of storing in a computer”. Concretely, we will represent a polynomial like
`1 + 3x + 7xˆ2` in Python as the list `[1,3,7]`. In general, we will store the coefficient of degree n in the list’s
nth entry

# Task 3 - Iteration, file handling, error handling, and dictionaries

## Introduction 

This lab contains several independent tasks involving important basic algorithms, dictionaries, file handling, and error handling.

# Task 4 - Program structure

## Introduction

In this lab, you will add error handling and plotting functionality to an existing program. You will begin from the relatively short program batch_means.py, which could use some improvement. You will find test data in the files sampleX.csv, for `X ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}`, in the same folder.

# Task 5 - Object-oriented programming

## Introduction

To introduce object-oriented programming, we will look at a computational problem from modern molecular biology. In DNA sequence analysis, we sometimes want to know how much overlap thereis between two sequences (simplified: how much DNA they have in common). You will write simple object-oriented code to support such an analysis.
